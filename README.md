# Week 1 Hackathon

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

At the end of our first week on the School of Code bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using prompts and alert boxes in vanilla JS.

As bonus tasks, we were asked to validate the player name and fix the odds so that the computer wins a predfined amount of times.
